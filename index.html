         <p>
            Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I
            could improve my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted
            to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on
            paper and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some
            challenge, something that makes more sense with what I thought. I
            saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user
            interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that the
            result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.

            <h4>Start with asking why</h4>
            <p>
               You will start seeing things differently and coming up with more
               effective ways of achieving goals.
            </p>
            <h4>Your ideas will have more value</h4>
            <p>
               By looking at problems from a different perspective, your ideas
               will be fresher and more valuable.

            <h4>Design solutions with love</h4>
            <p>
               Only when you experience a problem yourself do you understand the
               frustration of the users and resolve to end it.

            <p>
               As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that’s not
               finished or doesn’t look perfect. You will learn to accept
               feedback and learn from it.

Are you ready? Let’s go!! 
The challenge lasts 30 days. On each of those days you will have to create a solution to any problem you yourself are facing and show the result to the community.
Find your problem 
It has to be a problem that’s personally affecting or affected you, like finding your keys, calling a taxi or even remembering something. Open your eyes, look around you carefully and pay close attention to your surroundings.
Think about the solution 
It's time to look for solutions. What can you do to solve these problems? It's time to think out of the box, grab your notebook and start writing down all the ideas that come to mind.
Design your proposal 
How can design help solve your problem? It's time to think about features and functionality, and then start designing. Don’t forget to always ask yourself: Would I actually use this?
Share your work 
Share your design on instagram or dribbble with the hashtag #thedesignproject Remember to explain what the problem was, how you came up with the solution and how the design achieves it. Find out what people have to say about it.
