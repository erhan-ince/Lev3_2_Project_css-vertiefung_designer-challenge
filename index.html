How to become a better designer?
A challenge to improve your product design skills by solving problems in your daily life.
SCROLL TO SEE MORE —
Every idea starts with a need
Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more sense with what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that the result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.
After several weeks of sticking to this challenge, I learned a lot
Start with asking 
why You will start seeing things differently and coming up with more effective ways of achieving goals.
Your ideas will have more value 
By looking at problems from a different perspective, your ideas will be fresher and more valuable.
Design solutions with love 
Only when you experience a problem yourself do you understand the frustration of the users and resolve to end it.
Share and show your work 
As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that’s not finished or doesn’t look perfect. You will learn to accept feedback and learn from it.



Are you ready? Let’s go!! 
The challenge lasts 30 days. On each of those days you will have to create a solution to any problem you yourself are facing and show the result to the community.
Find your problem 
It has to be a problem that’s personally affecting or affected you, like finding your keys, calling a taxi or even remembering something. Open your eyes, look around you carefully and pay close attention to your surroundings.
Think about the solution 
It's time to look for solutions. What can you do to solve these problems? It's time to think out of the box, grab your notebook and start writing down all the ideas that come to mind.
Design your proposal 
How can design help solve your problem? It's time to think about features and functionality, and then start designing. Don’t forget to always ask yourself: Would I actually use this?
Share your work 
Share your design on instagram or dribbble with the hashtag #thedesignproject Remember to explain what the problem was, how you came up with the solution and how the design achieves it. Find out what people have to say about it.
